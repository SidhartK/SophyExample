# Steps for SISLers to use Sophy

1. Install the package via `pip install sophy-python`

2. Ensure that you have created a `.env` file and have written `SLACK_TOKEN={SISL_SLACKBOT_TOKEN}` to that file replacing `SISL_SLACKBOT_TOKEN` with the token for the SISL Slackbot.
   
3. Run `python example.py --email={YOUR_SISL_SLACK_EMAIL}` replacing `YOUR_SISL_SLACK_EMAIL` with the email you use in the SISL slack workspace.
